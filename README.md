The generic tokenizer expose a REST API that will return the words list and the number of times they appear in the text 

## Review
### Tokenizer's endpoint
```url
    [GET] /api/tokenizer
```
### Tokenizer's modes

There are several modes in which the tokenizer can be run:
* **cacheMode** - boolean (true as default),  When true the output will be stored as a cache for a time as defined in the configuration file (10 seconds by default). When the output is retrieved from the cache there will be an indication of this in the console.

* **streamMode** - boolean (true as default). When true he processing will be done using streams

* **dictionarySource** - full URL as string ( King Jamesâ€™ Bible as default)

The parameters will be sent as query string, for example:
```url
    /api/tokenizer?dictionarySource=http://urlOfSomething.com&&cacheMode=false
```
